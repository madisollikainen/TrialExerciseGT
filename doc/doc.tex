\title{Trial exercise for Guardtime: Merkle tree signing of log files}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

In the following I'll shortly describe my code produced for the trial exercise from Guardtime. 

\section{Task overview} % (fold)
\label{sec:task_overview}


A binary hash tree or a Merkle tree is a binary tree, where all the nodes are constructed via hashing their child nodes

\begin{equation}
 \text{parent node} \leftarrow hash( \text{child node 1}, \text{child node 2} ). 	
\end{equation} 

For log file signing one can construct a Merkle tree, whose leaves are the hashes of the lines of the log file. This allows for verification procedures for both the file as an whole as well as individual lines in the file. For individual lines, a hash chain starting from the leaf and ending at the root must be extracted. My trial exercise was to construct a toy tool for log files signing, which would enable:  

\begin{enumerate}
  	\item Signing of an arbitrary text file via signing the root of a binary hash tree (Merkle tree), whose leaves correspond to the hashes of the lines in the file.
  	\item Extraction of hash chains (from leaf to the root) for arbitrary lines in the text file.  
\end{enumerate}  

It was noted, that the signing processes itself can be implemented as just an empty function (a commented call to Guardtime SDK could also be added). The main part of the task was to implement the hash tree construction and hash chain extraction. Especially taking into account that the number of lines in a log file doesn't have to be a power of two.

\subsection{Merkle tree structure} % (fold)
\label{sub:merkle_tree_structure}

One of the key points in the task was the selection of an suitable tree structure for the Merkle tree. The tree should be easily constructible for any number of leaves without sacrificing too much of computational efficiency. I chose to use the \emph{canonical binary tree} introduced in \cite{Buldas2014}. Such an tree can be constructed in an \emph{on-line} manner, without previously knowing the number of leaves. The canonical Merkle tree used can neatly defined by the construction procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
 	
 	\item The leaves (hashes of the log file entries) are added from left-to-right.
 	
 	\item Moving from left-to-right the leaves will be gathered into a forest of complete trees.
 	
 	\item All of the complete trees will be as large as possible with the currently available leaves. Due to the above mentioned process it is clear that larger trees will be on the left and smaller on the right.

 	\item When parsing a file (or any other input entity) is complete and no more leaves (entries) are added to the tree, the resulting forest of complete trees can be merged into a single \emph{canonical} tree. This merger is done by merging the root nodes of trees in the forest from right-to-left. Thus first the two smallest trees are merged to form a larger tree, which is then in turn merged with the third smallest tree. This procedure is repeated until all of the trees have been merge into one.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Merkle tree root calculation} % (fold)
\label{sub:merkle_tree_root_calculation}

As noted in \cite{Buldas2014}, for calculating the root of the canonical binary tree only the roots of the complete trees in the forest (see \cref{sub:merkle_tree_structure}) have to be kept in memory. During the forest creation, some additional information is needed to make sure, that after each leaf is added, the complete trees in the forest are updated correctly. Fortunately this extra information can be neatly encoded into the layout of the array-like data structure storing the roots of the forest. 

Let's consider the forest of complete trees. Note, that every time a new leaf is added it will either become the root of the smallest tree in the forest (tree of hight $0$) or if there already was a tree of hight $0$ in the forest, it will be merged with this tree (it must have been the previously added leaf). In case of merger, if there was no other tree with hight $1$, the new tree will now be the smallest tree, but if there already was a tree of hight $1$ these two trees will be merged. Similar logic will continue recursively. We can see, that for each possible hight $h$ there can never be more than one tree of such high in the forest. Also it is possible, that there is no tree of such hight.

Thus the necessary information for correctly updating the forest after addition of a new leaf is reflected in knowing for which hight there is a tree in the forest and for which there isn't. When storing the roots of the complete tree in an array-like data structure, the hight of a tree can be encoded by the position of the root in the array. In such a case the size of the array would be set by the largest tree. The absence of a tree of hight $h<H$, where $H$ is the hight of the largest tree, can be marked by a suitable specifier being placed at position $h$. In my code, where I'm using \CC standard library strings for holding the hashes, this specifier is an empty string. In some other setting is could be something else, a null-pointer for example.

In my code the array-like data structure is \CC standard library vector of strings, which was chosen for ease of implementation. During the forest creation my code is reading the log file line-by-line. It hashes each of the lines and adds it into the forest as a new leaf. The forest is updated via looping over the vector holding the roots. For each step in the loop, the following rules are implemented:

\begin{itemize}
 	\item[(a)] The loop is exited when the first empty string is found. Finding of an empty string meant that there was no tree of that high in the forest before. Thus the new tree will have this hight and its root value is set to this position.   
 	\item[(b)] For every entry, which has a non-empty string, the current agglomerated root value is hashed together with that non-empty root value. This meant that there already was a tree of this hight in the forest and these two trees could be merged into a new larger tree. The non-empty string value is changed to be empty and the loop goes on.
 	\item[(c)] If the end of the vector is reached without finding any empty string, then that meant that there already was a tree of every hight from $0$ to $H$. Thus the new tree will now be of hight $H+1$ and the agglomerated root will be pushed to the back of the vector, increasing the size of the vector by one. Now we have a vector where for only the last value there is an non-empty string, for all previous values there will be an empty string. 
\end{itemize} 

After the end of the log file is reached, the forest of complete trees has been assembled and it's roots vector can be used to merge the forest into a single tree. This merger is done by yet again looping over the roots vector. Note that the roots in the beginning of the vector correspond to the small trees and the roots in the end correspond to the large one. Thus the merger is indeed done from the smallest to the largest (right-to-left). This time the loop is rather straight forward. The variable holding the final root value is initialised by the first non-empty value in the vector. Every empty string is just ignored. Every non-empty string is hashed together with the current value of the ``global root''. In the end we get the root value of the whole tree. I'll also note that in my code the hashing of two nodes to make a new one is always done such that the node on the left enters the function as the first argument and the node on the right enters it as the second argument.

\subsection{Hash chain extraction} % (fold)
\label{sub:hash_chain_extraction}

Given a specific line of the log file and the log file itself, the full hash chain from leaf to root can be extracted. Of-course, this can only be done, if the line given as an input actually does exist in the given log file. The hash chain consists of all the nodes on the path from the leaf to the root and of all the children nodes of these nodes. It is important that the user can take the chain and verify all of the hashing steps and results on the way from the leaf to the root. This is achieved by storing the chain as a sequence of pairs. The first value in a pair gives the position of the node in the hashing function for calculating its parent node. The second value is the node value itself. There is always an odd number of pairs in the chain. The pair on odd numbered positions in the sequence correspond to the node of the main path and the pairs on the even numbered positions correspond to the sibling nodes. Thus for calculating the value of the node on position $i+2$ the nodes on positions $i$ and $i+1$ have to be hashed together in the order specified by the first values in the pairs. 

For extracting such an hash chain, my code uses essentially the same algorithm as for calculating the root of the Merkle tree. The algorithm is slightly modified such that one could keep track of the values which should be added into the hash chain. This is done by always keeping track of the next value to be added to the chain. Let's call this value \emph{target}. Its initial value is the hash of the log file line for which the chain is being extracted. As stated, the algorithm is essentially the same as the one described in \cref{sub:merkle_tree_root_calculation}. But every time two nodes are hashed together to form their parent node, the code checks if one of these two nodes matches \emph{target}. If they don't, then nothing happens, but if one of them does, then both of these nodes are added to the hash chain, such that the node which matched \emph{target} is added first. The \emph{target} is then set to equal the parent node of these two nodes, as it is clearly the next node added to the chain.
